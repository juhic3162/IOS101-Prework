## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some of my favorite apps include:

**Google Calender**
- Minimalistic theme that gets the job done
- Different colors for different calenders, and the option to only view certain calenders at a time

**Discord**
- Organized chaos, with different channels to organize conversation
- Ability to manage notifications for exactly what the user prefers

**Spotify**
- Simple layout, allowing to easy access to buttons for skipping and pausing music
- Playlist reccomendations according to what the user frequently listens to

## Notes

While building the app, I struggled to understand how front end could interact with back end in Swift. These features were very different than what 
I was used to in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS front end - back end interaction.

Some ideas to improve the app in the future could be:
- Adding different fonts and text styles, so that the labels could change when the button is pressed
- Changing the location of the button each time it is pressed, to make it like a "whack-a-mole" game
